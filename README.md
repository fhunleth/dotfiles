# Frank's dotfiles

Shamelessly copied from Josh Adams (@knewter).

To install these suckers, just `./setup.sh`

## Fonts for airline, etc.
To install the fonts with powerline symbols, clone this repo: https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts
Then install the font you want and pick that as your terminal font.
